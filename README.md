This is a project I worked on in class.


# Queen Two-Player Game

In this game, two players take turns moving a black queen on a chessboard. The queen starts randomly in either the top row (row 8) or the rightmost column (column h). The goal is to move the queen to the bottom-left square (a1).
## Rules of the game:

- Players alternate turns to move the queen.
- During each turn, the player must move the queen following these rules:
  - The queen can move left, down, or diagonally left-down.
  - The queen must move exactly one square per turn.
- The game continues until the queen reaches the bottom-left square (a1).


## Example Gameplay:

1. PLAYER_1: (0, 3)
2. PLAYER_2: (1, 3)
3. PLAYER_1: (2, 2)
4. PLAYER_2: (3, 2)
5. PLAYER_1: (4, 1)
6. PLAYER_2: (5, 1)
7. PLAYER_1: (6, 0)
8. PLAYER_2: (7, 0)
9. PLAYER_2 wins
